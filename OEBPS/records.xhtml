<h1><span class="path">Computers:
Universe:</span> Records</h1>
<p>To recap: each record in a UniVerse file is made up of two
parts: a record key, which uniquely identifies the record within
the file, and record data, a string broken by field marks
(character #254) into fields, which holds information about
whatever the record represents.</p>
<p>For instance, in the case of a record on an application
<code>INVOICES</code> file, the key chosen by the system designer
would probably be the invoice number, while the fields would store
the invoice date, amount, sales tax amount, product code and
quantity.</p>
<p>Records are not necessarily the same length, and do not
necessarily have the same number of fields. While many represent
application data (such as the records in the <code>INVOICES</code>
file mentioned above), many others are UniVerse Basic programs in a
program file, or UniVerse command and keyword names, in the
<code>VOC</code> file, and so on.</p>
