<h1><span class="path">Computers:
Universe:</span> LOGIN, ON.EXIT and ON.ABORT</h1>
<p>Three VOC records define commands which are usually invoked by
UniVerse itself rather than being entered from the
<code>&gt;</code> prompt:</p>
<h2>LOGIN</h2>
<p>The <code>LOGIN</code> command is invoked whenever you enter a
particular UniVerse account: either from UNIX using the
<code>uv</code> command (see <span class="link" onclick=
"_goto('about-unix.html')">Universe and UNIX</span>), or from
another universe account by using the <code>LOGTO</code> command
(see <span class="link" onclick="_goto('prompt.html')&quot;">The
Command Prompt</span>).</p>
<p><code>LOGIN</code> must be a command, and could theoretically
therefore be a verb (see <span class="link" onclick=
"_goto('voc-verbs.html')">Verbs</span>), a sentence (see
<span class="link" onclick=
"_goto('voc-sentences.html')">Sentences</span>), or even a keyword
with a fourth field (see <span class="link" onclick=
"_goto('voc-keywords.html')">Keywords</span>). however, it is
almost always a paragraph (see <span class="link" onclick=
"_goto('voc-paragraphs.html')&quot;">Paragraphs</span>): analogous
perhaps to the UNIX <code>.profile</code> script (for those who
know UNIX).</p>
<p>The <code>LOGIN</code> command is useful for performing
initialisation (such as setting the terminal type with
<code>SET.TERM.TYPE</code>, see <span class="link" onclick=
"_goto('prompt.html')">The Command Prompt</span>), and frequently
invokes the main menu of an application as its last action.</p>
<h2>ON.EXIT</h2>
<p>Complementing <code>LOGIN</code> is the <code>ON.EXIT</code>
command, which UniVerse invokes when a user uses the
<code>QUIT</code> or <code>LO</code> commands to leave UniVerse
(see <span class="link" onclick="_goto('prompt.html')">The Command
Prompt</span>). Again, where it is defined at all it is usually
defined as a paragraph, and is sometimes used for logging activity,
displaying reminder messages, or, on friendly systems, simply
saying goodbye.</p>
<h2>ON.ABORT</h2>
<p>Finally, the <code>ON.ABORT</code> command is invoked when a
user uses the break key to break out of a process. It can be used
to deny access to the UniVerse command prompt (which appears if the
<code>ON.ABORT</code> paragraph is absent) or sometimes just to
reset 'sensible' terminal parameters, which may have been changed
by the program being broken out of.</p>
