# Life, The UniVerse, and Everything

Repository for Manny Neira's UniVerse book manually and painstakingly converted
to an epub form, for those who would prefer to read it on an ereader device.

original: http://www.mannyneira.com/universe/index.html

# Building

Use the makefile.  If you aren't on a proper platform, just manually put
mimetype, META-INF, and OEBPS into a zip file (make sure mimetype is added
first) and change the extension to .epub.

# Copyright and notes

All content belongs to Manny Neira.  I do not claim ownership of any of the
contents.

There may be mistakes here.  I don't claim any real knowledge of epub, and
threw this together with some automation and a lot of guesswork using the epub
standard and a couple tutorials.
